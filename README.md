# Scheme-Libs
A collection of R7RS libraries that I've written and that I use.

## Contents
`(lib heaps)` -- a simple implementation of the heap datastructure and the heapsort algorithm

`(lib args)` -- removes the first two and last command line args to fetch args when running a scheme file as a script under Cyclone Scheme

`(windows srfi 138)` -- an implementation of [SRFI 138](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-138/) for Larceny Scheme on Windows
